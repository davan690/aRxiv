## To Do list for [aRxiv](https://github.com/ropensci/aRxiv) package
    
- submitted and updated: replace the `"T"` with a space and remove the
  `"Z"`.  For example, `"2007-10-18T12:25:34Z"` to `"2007-10-18 12:25:34"`
- Weird results with arXiv IDs syntactically correct but not found
- Make it easier for users to refer to the arXiv subject
  classifications
- Also, include info on the ACM and MSC classifications
- Also, the search terms (like `au` and `cat`)
